# SpringBoot-Angularjs1.x_v2

Same as https://github.com/mhewedy/weekly-grocery but with maven instead of gradle and the npm/bower depencecies download.

To build angular depencecies, just go to: `src/main/resources/static/app` then run :

 `bower install`

first you need to install bower using: `npm install -g bower`


Then run the app run (alternatively, you can youse eclipse to run the spring boot project):

`mvn spring-boot:run`
